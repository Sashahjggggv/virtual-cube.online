										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><strong>Digitization, digitalization, digitalization, or digitization is a general term for converting something into a digital format.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>AERO3D company&#8217;s main activity profile is the digitization of the cultural heritage of Ukraine for its preservation: digitization of architectural and historical monuments, buildings, monuments, monuments, exhibits, creation of 3D Google tours and Matterport tours, individual 3D tours.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The range of possibilities of digitization in culture</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>We create 3D models of these objects using two technologies: photogrammetry and laser scanning. It is possible to use only photogrammetry &#8211; then we get a high-quality picture, but not clear dimensions. Or just a laser scan of the architecture &#8211; in this case, the dimensions and shapes will be perfectly preserved, but without a color picture, for example, a drawing. Therefore, we suggest combining these technologies to achieve an ideal result.</p>
<p>Digitalization can also be considered a created 3D tour of a museum or a 3D tour of an exhibition, an audio accompaniment of a 3D tour, a created digital exhibition of paintings, or an archive of museum exhibits on a modern and reliable platform.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>About digitization in culture</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Digitalization has become an important topic for the cultural sphere in recent years. This means the transition from traditional analog formats to digital formats for storing, processing, and transmitting the information. This process opens up new opportunities for the preservation, access, and dissemination of cultural resources, as well as for attracting new audiences to cultural heritage.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Examples of digitization in culture and beyond</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>One of the most obvious examples of digitization in culture is the transition to electronic books, audiobooks, and other electronic publication formats. This allows you to quickly and easily access books and other literature from anywhere with Internet access. In addition, digitization allows books and other resources to be stored electronically, reducing the risk of loss or damage.</p>
<p>Digitization also allows museum and archival collections to create digital copies of their resources, allowing a wider public to access cultural assets. In addition, it allows cultural resources to be preserved digitally, reducing the risk of their loss or damage.</p>
<p>Digitalization also enables the development of new forms of art and culture. For example, virtual reality and other technologies allow the creation of new impressions and experiences for viewers and listeners. In addition, digital tools allow artists and creators to create more complex and interactive works using various digital technologies. For example, virtual art exhibitions, interactive games based on cultural and historical events, multimedia performances and more.</p>
<p>Digitalization also allows cultural institutions and organizations to open up to new formats of audience engagement and the development of cooperation. For example, this can be the creation of online courses and training programs, the use of social networks, and other online tools to communicate with the audience and promote interaction.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Challenges of digitization</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>However, digitization also introduces new challenges and problems, in particular with regard to the preservation and protection of intellectual property, the spread of unauthorized copying and piracy, and the increasing inequality of access to cultural resources.</p>
<p>Therefore, digitalization is becoming more and more important for the cultural sphere, but it is necessary to carefully monitor its development and to solve the new challenges and problems that it introduces.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The AERO3D company continues to work in Kyiv under martial law and provide services:</strong></p></blockquote>

<li>Reverse engineering in Kyiv and Ukraine</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The war in Ukraine, which began in 2014, has been accompanied by numerous military actions and human rights violations, including crimes against cultural heritage. Russian aggression in the east of Ukraine led to the destruction and destruction of numerous cultural and historical monuments of Ukraine.</p>
<p>In particular, in the period from 2014 to 2022, many architectural monuments, including churches, castles and palaces, were destroyed. For example, the Intercession Church in the city of Sloviansk, located in the Donetsk region, was completely destroyed. Monuments of military architecture were also destroyed, in particular the fortress in the city of Luhansk.</p>
<p>At the same time, many museum collections, archaeological finds and other artifacts were stolen, destroyed or transported to Russia. For example, more than 800 exhibits, including rare books and paintings, were stolen from the open-air museum &#8220;Stary Krym&#8221; in Feodosia.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Russian occupation authorities introduce their own ideological and cultural standards, which lead to the destruction of Ukrainian culture and identity. For example, in the city of Sevastopol, which was occupied by Russian troops, an architectural monument was destroyed &#8211; the colonial villa &#8220;Krasny Pyatachok&#8221;, which was recognized as one of the symbols of the city.</p>
<p>In addition, in February 2021, it was reported that the Russian authorities destroyed more than 300 archives in Crimea. These archives stored historical documents, in particular, about the life of the Crimean Tatars and their repression during the Stalin era.</p>
<p>Also, as a result of the war in Donbas, many cultural objects were damaged or destroyed. For example, in the city of Avdiivka, the historical church of St. Nicholas and the Chekhov library were destroyed. In the city of Mariupol, a large collection of books and paintings was stored in the local art museum, but some of the exhibits were destroyed during hostilities.</p>
<p>In addition, Ukrainian cultural figures who do not support Russian aggression in Ukraine have become the object of persecution and repression. In particular, Ukrainian directors Oleg Sentsov and Serhiy Loznytsia were detained and convicted in Russia.</p>
<p>In general, the war in Ukraine has a serious impact on the cultural life of the country, destroying not only material objects, but also causing the loss of historical memory and cultural heritage.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The full scale of the Russian invasion of Ukraine resulted in the damage or destruction of more than 1,500 objects of cultural heritage and cultural infrastructure</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Minister of Culture and Information Policy, Oleksandr Tkachenko, spoke about this at the international forum on cultural heritage security &#8220;War in Ukraine: Battle for Culture&#8221;. According to information from the regions, hundreds of cultural heritage sites, dozens of museums, libraries and archives have been damaged or destroyed, and the number is increasing daily as the frontline keeps shifting and the Russians resort to rocket attacks and artillery fire. According to Tkachenko, some objects of cultural heritage were specially selected for destruction.</p>
<blockquote><p>As of March 18, 2023, the website <a href="https://culturecrimes.mkip.gov.ua/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">culturecrimes.mkip.gov</a>.ua states &#8220;The number of damaged and destroyed objects of cultural heritage and cultural institutions of Ukraine recorded in the database is 553.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The AERO3D team is engaged in 3D digitization of the crimes of Russia&#8217;s military aggression in Ukraine.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>About the hotel</strong></p>
<p>Hotel &#8220;Ukraine&#8221; welcomed its first guests in 1961, since then 90 rooms have welcomed guests of the city, the walls of the hotel restaurant have seen offers of hand and heart, in the conference halls they gathered for serious and not so serious meetings. And only the Russians decided to destroy a peaceful city with its historical sites.</p>
<p><strong>The hotel became a target for the Russian invaders</strong></p>
<p>On the night of March 12, 2022, a missile hit the hotel building, according to open sources, it was an Iskander missile or a FAB-500 aerial bomb. Fortunately, the hotel was unoccupied at the time, and no one was injured.</p>
<p><strong>In the summer of 2022, the AERO3D team digitized the Ukraine Hotel as part of its own project &#8220;War in 3D&#8221;</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Who is Banksy?</strong></p>
<p>For two decades, the identity of the scandalously famous English underground graffiti artist, political activist and director has not been established. But the residents of Borodyanka saw the artist and his team, and some managed to communicate with him and get to know him. &#8220;Thin&#8221;, &#8220;with a beard&#8221;, &#8220;45-50 years old&#8221; &#8211; all that is currently known.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" class="alignnone wp-image-4272" src="https://aero3d.ua/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/aero3d_borodyanka_banksy_2022-300x205.jpg" alt="" width="899" height="614" srcset="https://aero3d.ua/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/aero3d_borodyanka_banksy_2022-300x205.jpg 300w, https://aero3d.ua/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/aero3d_borodyanka_banksy_2022-1024x700.jpg 1024w, https://aero3d.ua/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/aero3d_borodyanka_banksy_2022-768x525.jpg 768w, https://aero3d.ua/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/aero3d_borodyanka_banksy_2022-1536x1050.jpg 1536w, https://aero3d.ua/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/aero3d_borodyanka_banksy_2022-2048x1400.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 899px) 100vw, 899px" /></p>
<p>According to the testimony of local residents in Borodyanka, Banksy painted his graffiti two weeks ago, at the moment this is the only graffiti with confirmed authorship &#8211; the artist posted a photo of his work on his Instagram. However, graffiti similar in style were seen in Ukraine a little earlier: a gymnast over a hole in a destroyed building in Irpen, in Kyiv &#8211; children seem to be swinging on an anti-tank hedgehog, in Gorenka a man in a bathtub, or a woman in a robe with a gas mask on her face and a fire extinguisher in her hands.</p>
<p>The AERO3D team also follows the artist&#8217;s works, so we set out to digitize his works in Borodyanka, Kyiv region. Soon we will be able to <a href="https://sketchfab.com/aero3d.ua">share 3D models</a> and videos on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_lN8wb6mUGCStTcmjLhcIA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube channel.</a> By the way, we managed to talk to the Ukrainian &#8220;Doc&#8221; from the movie &#8220;Back to the Future&#8221; &#8211; the man who, during the occupation of Kyiv region, poisoned 12 Kadyrivians with goat cheese with arsenic, to see and record on the camera and in 3D the results of the stay of the &#8220;Russian Mir&#8221; here, to talk with a military journalist who told scary stories. <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_lN8wb6mUGCStTcmjLhcIA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">All this in our video soon.</a></strong></p>
<p>We invite you to subscribe to our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aero3d.ua/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/aero3d.ua">Facebook</a> &#8211; that&#8217;s where we show the work process of professional photogrammetrists and share the results of our work, and our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_lN8wb6mUGCStTcmjLhcIA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> &#8211; so you don&#8217;t miss interesting videos.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the summer of 2021, the Mykolaiv Regional Art Museum named after V.V. Vereshchagin with the idea of ​​digitizing their exhibits in 3D.</p>
<p><strong>Plague to us, to AERO3D?</strong></p>
<p>We have been working since 2016 and have extensive experience in photogrammetry, laser scanning, and 3D modeling. Our works impress with detail and realism. We always go to meet our customers, consult on all issues, so that the result is perfect.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone  wp-image-4252" src="https://aero3d.ua/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/mykolaivskyj-khudozhnij-muzej-aero3d-300x213.jpeg" alt="" width="885" height="628" srcset="https://aero3d.ua/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/mykolaivskyj-khudozhnij-muzej-aero3d-300x213.jpeg 300w, https://aero3d.ua/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/mykolaivskyj-khudozhnij-muzej-aero3d-768x545.jpeg 768w, https://aero3d.ua/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/mykolaivskyj-khudozhnij-muzej-aero3d.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 885px) 100vw, 885px" /></p>
<p><strong>Mykolaiv Regional Art Museum named after V.V. Vereshchagina &#8211; the museum was founded in 1914 in honor of the great combat artist.</strong></p>
<p>The museum is located in one of the best buildings in the city, which is an architectural monument of the second half of the 19th century.</p>
<p>Mykolaiv Regional Art Museum named after V.V. Vereshchagina, became one of the recognized centers of culture and aesthetic education in the city. <strong>Today, the museum&#8217;s collection includes up to eighteen thousand exhibits, which are a kind of artistic chronicle of Ukraine and many other countries.</strong></p>
<p>In the halls there is an exhibition of works, which includes painting, sculpture, graphics and decorative and applied art.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks of the project</strong></p>
<p>Perform 3D digitization of museum exhibits within the framework of the &#8220;Art Museum Digital Collection&#8221; and &#8220;Art Museum Digital Collection: Porcelain&#8221; projects. The porcelain museum collection consists of dishes (cup, saucer, vase, saucer, plate, etc.) and figurines. These are products from the countries of Western Europe at the end of the 18th and 20th centuries. (Germany, Austria, France, England, Spain), Eastern Europe of the beginning of the 19th &#8211; mid-20th centuries. (Ukraine, Poland and Russia) and East Asia of the 20th century. (Japan and China).</p>
<p><strong>Ways to complete the task</strong></p>
<p>After talking with the customer, we decided to use photogrammetry technology, which makes it possible to obtain high detail and an authentic look of museum exhibits.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our AERO3D team created the first online museum of aviation and modernity in Ukraine <a href="https://aero3d.ua/en/projects/sadyba-sikorskoho/">MUSEUM SIKOR SKY</a> &#8211; moved the aircraft designer&#8217;s house into virtual reality Igor Sikorsky.</p>
<p>Igor Sikorsky is one of the greatest and most famous aircraft designers in the world. <strong>International Airport &#8220;Kyiv&#8221; named after I. Sikorsky</strong> and <strong>Kyiv Polytechnic Institute named after Ihor Sikorsky</strong> are named after him in Kyiv.</p>
<p><em>Despite the fact that Kyiv houses the house where the world aviation genius was born, Ukraine does not have a Museum named after him. Consequently, Ukraine is losing a huge potential for popularizing the country of talents. The creation of the SIKOR SKY virtual MUSEUM solves this problem to a large extent by highlighting, demonstrating and popularizing the history of Igor Sikorsky.</em></p>
<p>In 2019, the head of our company AERO3D &#8211; Serhii Prysiazhnyi and Olga Barkova &#8211; the head of the platform <a href="https://www.dcvisu.sikorsky.kiev.ua/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DC-Visu</a>, the NGO &#8220;GraDeSvit&#8221; started work on the creation of a virtual 3D museum of Igor Sikorsky &#8211; a world aviation genius who was born and took the first steps to recognition in Kyiv.</p>
<p><em>Thanks to this project, the problem of digital 3D preservation of a historic building, which is in a state of emergency, is solved, the creation of its identical digital 3D model, the possibility of its further use for carrying out repair and restoration works of the building.</em>*</p>
<p><em>Multimedia-immersive technology provides deep immersion in the virtual museum exhibition as a creative product, which contributes to obtaining one&#8217;s own experience of experiencing the era in general and the biography of Igor Sikorsky in particular &#8211; in the historical, cultural and technical aspects of the inventions of Ukrainian pioneers of world aviation.</em></p>
<p>The painstaking work of our team on the implementation of the idea lasted half a year, and in 2020 we presented the online museum.</p>
<p>To implement the project, laser scanning technologies with photogrammetry were used, as a safe, non-contact technology of three-dimensional imaging of an object to create its digital image using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV, drone). We processed the received photos in special software and as a result received a <a href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/house-of-aircraft-designer-igor-sikorsky-c5ad38f6e2544f26826cce3f3b74855f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3D model&lt;/a &gt; a real existing house.</a></p>
<p>The next step was the creation of a virtual reconstruction of the first floor (with interiors, furniture and decoration in accordance with the modern era of late XIX-early XX centuries), as well as a virtual hub space of 2-3 floors.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the estate in which the famous aircraft designer once lived is now in a state of disrepair, and no photographs of its former appearance have been preserved. Therefore, in order to reproduce in the most accurate form all the subtleties of the interior, it was necessary to rely on the era, wealth, needs and tastes of the Sikorsky family, to involve historical experts. With the help of 3D modeling, each household item in the house was created separately.</p>
<p><strong>We have created a digital museum where you can walk through the corridors and rooms, examine the objects, get more detailed information about each object in the digital collection, visit additional exhibitions &#8211; music and painting.</strong></p>
<p>Digitization of the aircraft designer itself was possible thanks to cooperation with the Museum of the Formation of the Nation &#8211; it is there that the silicone figure of I. Sikorsky is kept.</p>
<p>In addition to the <a href="https://aero3d.ua/virtualni-3d-tury/">virtual 3d tour</a> museum, which allows anyone to walk around the house on a Google map, for the clever there is a quest-museum, which is downloaded on the computer as a game and has 52 interactive test tasks. Unreal Engine was used for gamification of interactive tours.</p>
<p>We hope that later on the basis of our work, the physical restoration of the house, as well as of our entire great country, will be carried out!</p>
<p>Imagining is good, and now we offer a short video to take a walk through the virtual museum. <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tp2zW 2qKtQ&amp;t=209s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We are waiting for your questions, feedback in YouTube comments, because we are all Ukrainians and want to be better together! </a></strong></p>
