It is possible to use only photogrammetry &#8211; then we get a high-quality picture, but not clear dimensions. Or just a laser scan of the architecture &#8211; in this case, the dimensions and shapes will be perfectly preserved, but without a color picture, for example, a drawing. Therefore, we suggest combining these technologies to achieve an ideal result.<\/p>\n<p>Digitalization can also be considered a created 3D tour of a museum or a 3D tour of an exhibition, an audio accompaniment of a 3D tour, a created digital exhibition of paintings, or an archive of museum exhibits on a modern and reliable platform.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>About digitization in culture<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Digitalization has become an important topic for the cultural sphere in recent years. This means the transition from traditional analog formats to digital formats for storing, processing, and transmitting the information. This process opens up new opportunities for the preservation, access, and dissemination of cultural resources, as well as for attracting new audiences to cultural heritage.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Examples of digitization in culture and beyond<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>One of the most obvious examples of digitization in culture is the transition to electronic books, audiobooks, and other electronic publication formats. This allows you to quickly and easily access books and other literature from anywhere with Internet access. In addition, digitization allows books and other resources to be stored electronically, reducing the risk of loss or damage.<\/p>\n<p>Digitization also allows museum and archival collections to create digital copies of their resources, allowing a wider public to access cultural assets. In addition, it allows cultural resources to be preserved digitally, reducing the risk of their loss or damage.<\/p>\n<p>Digitalization also enables the development of new forms of art and culture. For example, virtual reality and other technologies allow the creation of new impressions and experiences for viewers and listeners. In addition, digital tools allow artists and creators to create more complex and interactive works using various digital technologies. For example, virtual art exhibitions, interactive games based on cultural and historical events, multimedia performances and more.<\/p>\n<p>Digitalization also allows cultural institutions and organizations to open up to new formats of audience engagement and the development of cooperation. For example, this can be the creation of online courses and training programs, the use of social networks, and other online tools to communicate with the audience and promote interaction.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Challenges of digitization<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>However, digitization also introduces new challenges and problems, in particular with regard to the preservation and protection of intellectual property, the spread of unauthorized copying and piracy, and the increasing inequality of access to cultural resources.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, digitalization is becoming more and more important for the cultural sphere, but it is necessary to carefully monitor its development and to solve the new challenges and problems that it introduces.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>The Virtual-Cube company continues to work in Kyiv under martial law and provide services:<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Reverse engineering in Kyiv and Ukraine<\/li>\n<li>3D modeling in Kyiv and Ukraine &#8211; 3D modeling Kyiv<\/li>\n<li>3D printing in Kyiv and Ukraine<\/li>\n<li>Photogrammetry (3D digitization) in Kyiv and Ukraine &#8211; photogrammetry Kyiv<\/li>\n<li>Laser scanning in Kyiv and Ukraine &#8211; laser scanning Kyiv<\/li>\n<li>Creation of 3D Matterport tours in Kyiv and Ukraine &#8211; 3D tour Kyiv<\/li>\n<li>The creation of 3D Google tours is suspended due to Google&#8217;s policy.
