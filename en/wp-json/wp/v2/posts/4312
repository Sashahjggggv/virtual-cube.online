This technology has found widespread use in various fields, including architecture, engineering, construction, cultural heritage, and industry.<\/p>\n<p>The laser scanning process consists of several stages. First, preliminary preparation is carried out, which includes setting up the scanner and connecting it to a computer. The scanner then uses a laser beam to read the surface of the object and collects data about its shape, texture, and colors.<\/p>\n<p>After data collection, processing is carried out, which includes editing and aligning the data to create an accurate three-dimensional model of the object. This can be done using special software that allows for the creation of large and complex models.<\/p>\n<p>The obtained model can be used to measure various parameters of the object, from area and volume to distance between different points. Laser scanning can also be used to create high-quality topographic maps and models of the terrain.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most interesting applications of laser scanning is the preservation of cultural heritage. Many historical and cultural buildings have been destroyed or damaged by time, wars, and natural disasters. Thanks to laser scanning, it is possible to restore and virtualize these structures.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Laser scanning is a technology that uses a laser beam to create an accurate three-dimensional model of an object or surface.
