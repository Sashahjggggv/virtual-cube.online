Sikorsky<\/strong> and <strong>Kyiv Polytechnic Institute named after Ihor Sikorsky<\/strong> are named after him in Kyiv.<\/p>\n<p><em>Despite the fact that Kyiv houses the house where the world aviation genius was born, Ukraine does not have a Museum named after him. Consequently, Ukraine is losing a huge potential for popularizing the country of talents. The creation of the SIKOR SKY virtual MUSEUM solves this problem to a large extent by highlighting, demonstrating and popularizing the history of Igor Sikorsky.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>In 2019, the head of our company AERO3D &#8211; Serhii Prysiazhnyi and Olga Barkova &#8211; the head of the platform <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dcvisu.sikorsky.kiev.ua\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DC-Visu<\/a>, the NGO &#8220;GraDeSvit&#8221; started work on the creation of a virtual 3D museum of Igor Sikorsky &#8211; a world aviation genius who was born and took the first steps to recognition in Kyiv.<\/p>\n<p><em>Thanks to this project, the problem of digital 3D preservation of a historic building, which is in a state of emergency, is solved, the creation of its identical digital 3D model, the possibility of its further use for carrying out repair and restoration works of the building.<\/em>*<\/p>\n<p><em>Multimedia-immersive technology provides deep immersion in the virtual museum exhibition as a creative product, which contributes to obtaining one&#8217;s own experience of experiencing the era in general and the biography of Igor Sikorsky in particular &#8211; in the historical, cultural and technical aspects of the inventions of Ukrainian pioneers of world aviation.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The painstaking work of our team on the implementation of the idea lasted half a year, and in 2020 we presented the online museum.<\/p>\n<p>To implement the project, laser scanning technologies with photogrammetry were used, as a safe, non-contact technology of three-dimensional imaging of an object to create its digital image using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV, drone). We processed the received photos in special software and as a result received a <a href=\"https:\/\/sketchfab.com\/3d-models\/house-of-aircraft-designer-igor-sikorsky-c5ad38f6e2544f26826cce3f3b74855f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">3D model&lt;\/a &gt; a real existing house.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The next step was the creation of a virtual reconstruction of the first floor (with interiors, furniture and decoration in accordance with the modern era of late XIX-early XX centuries), as well as a virtual hub space of 2-3 floors.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the estate in which the famous aircraft designer once lived is now in a state of disrepair, and no photographs of its former appearance have been preserved. Therefore, in order to reproduce in the most accurate form all the subtleties of the interior, it was necessary to rely on the era, wealth, needs and tastes of the Sikorsky family, to involve historical experts. With the help of 3D modeling, each household item in the house was created separately.<\/p>\n<p><strong>We have created a digital museum where you can walk through the corridors and rooms, examine the objects, get more detailed information about each object in the digital collection, visit additional exhibitions &#8211; music and painting.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Digitization of the aircraft designer itself was possible thanks to cooperation with the Museum of the Formation of the Nation &#8211; it is there that the silicone figure of I. Sikorsky is kept.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the <a href=\"https:\/\/virtual-cube.online\/virtualni-3d-tury\/\">virtual 3d tour<\/a> museum, which allows anyone to walk around the house on a Google map, for the clever there is a quest-museum, which is downloaded on the computer as a game and has 52 interactive test tasks. Unreal Engine was used for gamification of interactive tours.<\/p>\n<p>We hope that later on the basis of our work, the physical restoration of the house, as well as of our entire great country, will be carried out!<\/p>\n<p>Imagining is good, and now we offer a short video to take a walk through the virtual museum. <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0tp2zW 2qKtQ&amp;t=209s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">We are waiting for your questions, feedback in YouTube comments, because we are all Ukrainians and want to be better together! <\/a><\/strong><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our AERO3D team created the first online museum of aviation and modernity in Ukraine MUSEUM SIKOR SKY &#8211; moved the aircraft designer&#8217;s house into virtual reality Igor Sikorsky.
