										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>About the hotel</strong></p>
<p>Hotel &#8220;Ukraine&#8221; welcomed its first guests in 1961, since then 90 rooms have welcomed guests of the city, the walls of the hotel restaurant have seen offers of hand and heart, in the conference halls they gathered for serious and not so serious meetings. And only the Russians decided to destroy a peaceful city with its historical sites.</p>
<p><strong>The hotel became a target for the Russian invaders</strong></p>
<p>On the night of March 12, 2022, a missile hit the hotel building, according to open sources, it was an Iskander missile or a FAB-500 aerial bomb. Fortunately, the hotel was unoccupied at the time, and no one was injured.</p>
<p><strong>In the summer of 2022, the AERO3D team digitized the Ukraine Hotel as part of its own project &#8220;War in 3D&#8221;</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Who is Banksy?</strong></p>
<p>For two decades, the identity of the scandalously famous English underground graffiti artist, political activist and director has not been established. But the residents of Borodyanka saw the artist and his team, and some managed to communicate with him and get to know him. &#8220;Thin&#8221;, &#8220;with a beard&#8221;, &#8220;45-50 years old&#8221; &#8211; all that is currently known.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" class="alignnone wp-image-4272" src="https://aero3d.ua/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/aero3d_borodyanka_banksy_2022-300x205.jpg" alt="" width="899" height="614" srcset="https://aero3d.ua/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/aero3d_borodyanka_banksy_2022-300x205.jpg 300w, https://aero3d.ua/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/aero3d_borodyanka_banksy_2022-1024x700.jpg 1024w, https://aero3d.ua/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/aero3d_borodyanka_banksy_2022-768x525.jpg 768w, https://aero3d.ua/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/aero3d_borodyanka_banksy_2022-1536x1050.jpg 1536w, https://aero3d.ua/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/aero3d_borodyanka_banksy_2022-2048x1400.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 899px) 100vw, 899px" /></p>
<p>According to the testimony of local residents in Borodyanka, Banksy painted his graffiti two weeks ago, at the moment this is the only graffiti with confirmed authorship &#8211; the artist posted a photo of his work on his Instagram. However, graffiti similar in style were seen in Ukraine a little earlier: a gymnast over a hole in a destroyed building in Irpen, in Kyiv &#8211; children seem to be swinging on an anti-tank hedgehog, in Gorenka a man in a bathtub, or a woman in a robe with a gas mask on her face and a fire extinguisher in her hands.</p>
<p>The AERO3D team also follows the artist&#8217;s works, so we set out to digitize his works in Borodyanka, Kyiv region. Soon we will be able to <a href="https://sketchfab.com/aero3d.ua">share 3D models</a> and videos on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_lN8wb6mUGCStTcmjLhcIA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube channel.</a> By the way, we managed to talk to the Ukrainian &#8220;Doc&#8221; from the movie &#8220;Back to the Future&#8221; &#8211; the man who, during the occupation of Kyiv region, poisoned 12 Kadyrivians with goat cheese with arsenic, to see and record on the camera and in 3D the results of the stay of the &#8220;Russian Mir&#8221; here, to talk with a military journalist who told scary stories. <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_lN8wb6mUGCStTcmjLhcIA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">All this in our video soon.</a></strong></p>
<p>We invite you to subscribe to our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aero3d.ua/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/aero3d.ua">Facebook</a> &#8211; that&#8217;s where we show the work process of professional photogrammetrists and share the results of our work, and our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_lN8wb6mUGCStTcmjLhcIA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> &#8211; so you don&#8217;t miss interesting videos.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the summer of 2021, the Mykolaiv Regional Art Museum named after V.V. Vereshchagin with the idea of ​​digitizing their exhibits in 3D.</p>
<p><strong>Plague to us, to AERO3D?</strong></p>
<p>We have been working since 2016 and have extensive experience in photogrammetry, laser scanning, and 3D modeling. Our works impress with detail and realism. We always go to meet our customers, consult on all issues, so that the result is perfect.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone  wp-image-4252" src="https://aero3d.ua/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/mykolaivskyj-khudozhnij-muzej-aero3d-300x213.jpeg" alt="" width="885" height="628" srcset="https://aero3d.ua/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/mykolaivskyj-khudozhnij-muzej-aero3d-300x213.jpeg 300w, https://aero3d.ua/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/mykolaivskyj-khudozhnij-muzej-aero3d-768x545.jpeg 768w, https://aero3d.ua/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/mykolaivskyj-khudozhnij-muzej-aero3d.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 885px) 100vw, 885px" /></p>
<p><strong>Mykolaiv Regional Art Museum named after V.V. Vereshchagina &#8211; the museum was founded in 1914 in honor of the great combat artist.</strong></p>
<p>The museum is located in one of the best buildings in the city, which is an architectural monument of the second half of the 19th century.</p>
<p>Mykolaiv Regional Art Museum named after V.V. Vereshchagina, became one of the recognized centers of culture and aesthetic education in the city. <strong>Today, the museum&#8217;s collection includes up to eighteen thousand exhibits, which are a kind of artistic chronicle of Ukraine and many other countries.</strong></p>
<p>In the halls there is an exhibition of works, which includes painting, sculpture, graphics and decorative and applied art.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks of the project</strong></p>
<p>Perform 3D digitization of museum exhibits within the framework of the &#8220;Art Museum Digital Collection&#8221; and &#8220;Art Museum Digital Collection: Porcelain&#8221; projects. The porcelain museum collection consists of dishes (cup, saucer, vase, saucer, plate, etc.) and figurines. These are products from the countries of Western Europe at the end of the 18th and 20th centuries. (Germany, Austria, France, England, Spain), Eastern Europe of the beginning of the 19th &#8211; mid-20th centuries. (Ukraine, Poland and Russia) and East Asia of the 20th century. (Japan and China).</p>
<p><strong>Ways to complete the task</strong></p>
<p>After talking with the customer, we decided to use photogrammetry technology, which makes it possible to obtain high detail and an authentic look of museum exhibits.</p>
